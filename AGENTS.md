- Offline: vite-plugin-pwa generateSW writes sw.js into dist/client; registration only via src/lib/pwa.ts (guarded off in dev/preview). Why: SSR app has no index.html, so pages use NetworkFirst runtime cache warmed on registration.
- Encounters persist in IndexedDB (src/lib/db.ts), not localStorage. Why: durable offline storage across app restarts.
